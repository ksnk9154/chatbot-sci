This is a sample document for the chatbot. It contains information about science and technology. The chatbot uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity to retrieve relevant text chunks based on user queries. Documents are split into chunks of approximately 150 words each. This allows for efficient searching and retrieval of information without relying on large language models. The backend is built with Flask and provides a simple API for the frontend to interact with. Users can ask questions related to the content in these documents, and the system will return the most relevant passages along with similarity scores.
